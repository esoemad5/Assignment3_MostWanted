Validation: Given by instructors, seems ok.
	need to validate searches (gender must be male/female, age/height/weight must be number, eye color/occupation must be string

Search on single critera:
	You can, but if multiple results, you are forced to search on 2-5 critera.

Search on 2-5 critera:
	Works, but Joey and Elen Madden have all the same traits. Need to allow user to pick from a shortened list.

Lookup Info:
	Doesn't work.

lookup descendants with recursion:
	Can find children, but not all children. does not use recursion. Also returns it in a dumb way.

lookup immediate family: doesn't work

commits: Good
